Advanced Farming and Water Works

Welcome to Advanced Farming and Water Works mod by ocbMaurice.


Advanced Farming - Fertilization

In order to grow plants you need fertilze soil first. This is either done
by fertilizing existing terrain (like on previous 7D2D alpha versions) by
using the Fertilization Hoe. Or use the regular Farm Plots or the advanced
Farm Plot. All these will allow you to put plants down, but they will not
really grow without light, water and compost.

Light will of course be provided automatically if growing over ground.
When underground or under a roof you'll need artificial grow lights.

Water is either provided by a nearby well or by the integrated pipe
system inside the Advanced Farm Plots. The Advanced Farm Plots can
also take cleaner water to increase growth rate drastically.

Compost needs to be provided by a nearby Composter. It will make sure
that soil quality of nearby soil will keep its fertility over time.

Advanced Farming - Irrigation via Wells

The Apocalypse and Radiated Zombies have made the soil unusable to grow
plants directly on the ground. You will need to fertilize the ground first
and ensure it is provided with clean enough ground water to grow plants.

Wells are the easiest and earliest way to provide clean eough water to
plants and are easily accessible early game. Altough a well will require
a substantial amount of resources to build (stone, wood and clay).
Once placed, it will only very slowly accumulate water and plants
can use up that water rather quickly. It can also only serve that
water in a very limited radius. So while it is useable to grow a
few plants this way, it will not be enough rather soon.

To greatly increase the water flow, you must irrigate the soil nearby
with an Irrigation Pump. This Pump must be connected to a Water Source,
e.g. a lake or a river and connected via pipes to the Irrigation Pump.
The Irrigation Pump has a very big reach, but plants can't use that
water directly. Only after it is filtered in a well, plants nearby
the well can use that filtered ground water to grow.

Note: you can fill the well via murky water jars or buckets. You
can also use the well as a water source to fill these containers.

Advanced Farming - Irrigation via Farm Plots

In order to grow more plants more dense and faster, you will need
to switch to Farm Plots at some points. The added barriers will
greatly help to keep the water where it belongs and they can be
filled directly by connecting them with pipes to a water source.
Farm Plots connect to each other like other water reservoirs and
levels will balance between them over time.

Farm Plots can also be filled with clean or fertilized water, which
will increase the grow speed.




Advanced Farming - Plant Illness

All plants have a chance to be visited by parasites, but plants that
are growing near each other will greatly increase the chance for all
plants to become infested. So spread out plants as much as possible.
Once a plant becomes infested, you can pour pesticide manually over
the plant to reduce the plague. Plants that grow faster have a far
smaller chance to become infested until they're fully grown.

Pesticides can also be automatically applied to plants by spinklers.
So in order to successfully grow a garden you either need to attend
if manually from time to time or invest in the necessary tools to
automate most of the tedious work. Plants that become fully infested
will stop their growth and will ultimately slowly wither.

Advanced Farming - Plant health and sprinklers

In order to reduce parasites you can use sprinklers to spray either
clean water or pesticide. Clean water will only slightly improve the
situation by partially keeping the parasites away. Only pesticides
will really keep the plague in order.

The outdoor sprinkler covers a big area, but will also waste a lot of
resources. Better use indoor sprinklers to apply it more precisely.

Pesticide needs to be produced by the Pesticide Mixer, which requires
a piped clean water source and pesticide concentrate, which is made
in a chemical station. So in order to keep it going, you need to
provide the pesticide concentrate manually and keep electricity up
for the water pipe comoponents.
