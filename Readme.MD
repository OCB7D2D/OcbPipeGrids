## Kitchen Sink

Goal: Be able to get murky water and clean water from tap

- Do we really want to need to connect each one by pipe?
- Piping will be hard and weird to run through a house!?
- I'd rather walk a few steps than needing to do that!?
- It's also not too hard to get enough of it anyway!?

Solution: Tap into available sources.

- What should that be? Water Tower or Water Tank?
- Idea: Anything higher than sink can be a source
- Assuming pipes are just installed for that part
- Like a "global" house installation done once

Note: It's really just a side kick

- Doesn't change the game by much anyway
- Until we had some real water need (plants)

Future: Add more appliances, e.g water cooker

- Or glue maker or other fancy kitchen items
- But not part of this mod certainly!

# Plants

- Plants can get sick and will grow much slower
- Feule, Parasiten, Pilze

- Sprinkler can be used to deploy these?
- Must be able to also do it manually!?

## Plant Sickness

Plants get randomly sick by a given chance.

- Sickness check is random by chance itself
- This chance is lowered by sprinklers
- Can we make some distance related modifiers?
- On sickness check, we check plants around
- The more plants, the higher the chance
- If one is already sick, chance is much higher
- Maybe make a "infect another plant" ticker?

- Sick plants need to be replaces or can be healed?
- Manual intervention seems appropriate here.
- If you neglect it, it dies.

## Sprinkler

- Clean water lower chance of illness?
- Sprinkler can only do that?
- Who does medicine?

# What about underground

- Additional light needed!!!
- Water by well? Weird!
- Over top water pipes/sprinkler?

## Block grids?

- Solid blocks beside each other
